A simple status bar, written using [iced-rs](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/) (purely rust)

Currently supports only a bare minimum of configuration and is only working on [hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/).

For a list of currently supported modules, see [the Wiki](https://github.com/Faervan/bar-rs/wiki#modules)

## Installation
To use bar-rs you have to build the project yourself (very straight forward on an up-to-date system like Arch, harder on "stable" ones like Debian due to outdated system libraries)

```sh
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/faervan/bar-rs.git
cd bar-rs

# Build the project - This might take a while
cargo build --release

# Install the bar-rs helper script to easily launch and kill bar-rs
bash install.sh

# Optional: Clean unneeded build files afterwards:
find target/release/* ! -name bar-rs ! -name . -type d,f -exec rm -r {} +
```

## Extra dependencies
bar-rs depends on the following cli utilities:
- free
- grep
- awk
- printf
- pactl
- wpctl
- playerctl

## Usage
Either launch bar-rs directly:

```sh
./target/release/bar-rs
# or using cargo:
cargo run --release
```

or using the `bar-rs` script (after installing it using the `install.sh` script)
```sh
bar-rs open
```

## Configuration
See [the Wiki](https://github.com/Faervan/bar-rs/wiki)

## Hyprland configuration
[iced-rs](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/) uses [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/) as it's windowing shell, which has no support for the [`wlr layer shell protocol`](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1) yet, though there is [effort](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/4044) made to implement it

For this reason, some hyprland rules are needed to make bar-rs behave as it should:
```
windowrule = monitor DP-1, bar-rs # replace with your monitor name
windowrule = pin, bar-rs
windowrule = float, bar-rs
windowrule = nofocus, bar-rs
windowrule = noborder, bar-rs
windowrule = move 0 0, bar-rs
windowrule = decorate 0, bar-rs
windowrule = rounding 0, bar-rs
```
You might want to add rules similar to these, if you set `close_on_fullscreen` to false (see [Configuration](#configuration)):
```
windowrulev2 = opacity 0, onworkspace:f[0], class:(bar-rs)
windowrulev2 = noblur 1, onworkspace:f[0], class:(bar-rs)
```

Also, add this line to launch bar-rs on startup:
```
exec-once = bar-rs open
```

To have the `hyprland.workspaces` module show some nice workspace icons, set rules for your workspaces like this:
```
workspace = 1, defaultName:ó°ˆ¹
```

## Logs
If bar-rs is launched via the `bar-rs` script, it's logs are saved to `/tmp/bar-rs.log` and should only contain anything if there is an error.
If an error occurs and all dependencies are installed on your system, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/faervan/bar-rs/issues)

## Recommendations + feature requests
If you have an idea on what could improve bar-rs, or you would like to see a specific feature implemented, please open an [issue](https://github.com/faervan/bar-rs/issues).

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, create an [issue](https://github.com/faervan/bar-rs/issues) about the feature you'd like to implement or comment on an existing one. You may also contact me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/738658712620630076).

## Extra credits
Next to all the great crates this projects depends on (see `Cargo.toml`) and the cli utils listed in [Extra dependencies](#extra-dependencies), bar-rs also uses [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (see `assets/3270`)
