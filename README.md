A simple status bar, written using [iced-rs](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/) (purely rust)

Vertical status bars are only experimentally supported right now...

Currently bar-rs supports only a bare minimum of configuration. It works on Wayland compositors implementing the [wlr layer shell protocol](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1#compositor-support), but only features [hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/) modules for active workspace and window display.

For a list of all currently supported modules, see [the Wiki](https://github.com/Faervan/bar-rs/wiki#modules)

## Installation
To use bar-rs you have to build the project yourself (very straight forward on an up-to-date system like Arch, harder on "stable" ones like Debian due to outdated system libraries)

```sh
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/faervan/bar-rs.git
cd bar-rs

# Build the project - This might take a while
cargo build --release

# Install the bar-rs helper script to easily launch and kill bar-rs
bash install.sh

# Optional: Clean unneeded build files afterwards:
find target/release/* ! -name bar-rs ! -name . -type d,f -exec rm -r {} +
```

## Extra dependencies
bar-rs depends on the following cli utilities:
- free
- grep
- awk
- printf
- pactl
- wpctl
- playerctl

## Usage
Either launch bar-rs directly:

```sh
./target/release/bar-rs
# or using cargo:
cargo run --release
```

or using the `bar-rs` script (after installing it using the `install.sh` script)
```sh
bar-rs open
```

## Configuration
See [the Wiki](https://github.com/Faervan/bar-rs/wiki)

## Hyprland configuration
Add this line to your `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` to launch bar-rs on startup:
```
exec-once = bar-rs open
```

To have the `hyprland.workspaces` module show some nice workspace icons, set rules for your workspaces like this:
```
workspace = 1, defaultName:ó°ˆ¹
```
Find some nice icons to use [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet)

## Logs
If bar-rs is launched via the `bar-rs` script, it's logs are saved to `/tmp/bar-rs.log` and should only contain anything if there is an error.
If an error occurs and all dependencies are installed on your system, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/faervan/bar-rs/issues)

## Recommendations + feature requests
